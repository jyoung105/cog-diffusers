## Abstract

(Summarized by GPT-4o)

The article titled "Playground v2: A new leap in creativity" announces the release of Playground v2, an advanced graphics model developed by Playground. 

**Key Highlights:**

* **Open-Source Availability:** Playground v2 is available for public use on [playground.com](https://playground.com/) and can be downloaded from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/). 

* **Commercial Use Permitted:** Users are allowed to utilize Playground v2 for commercial purposes, providing flexibility for various applications. 

* **Benchmark Performance:** Early benchmarks indicate that Playground v2 is preferred 2.5 times more than Stable Diffusion XL across thousands of prompts, highlighting its superior performance. 

* **MJHQ-30K Benchmark:** The introduction of the MJHQ-30K benchmark allows for automatic evaluation of a modelâ€™s aesthetic quality by computing the FrÃ©chet Inception Distance (FID) on a high-quality dataset curated from Midjourney. 

* **Pre-Trained Weights Release:** To support research in environments with limited computational resources, Playground has released pre-trained weights of the model in 256px and 512px stages on HuggingFace. 

The article also acknowledges the contributions of the Playground Research Team and invites individuals interested in advancing computer graphics to explore career opportunities with Playground.
