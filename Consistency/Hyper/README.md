## Abstract

(Summarized by GPT-4o)

The paper titled "Hyper-SD: Trajectory Segmented Consistency Model for Efficient Image Synthesis" introduces Hyper-SD, a framework designed to enhance the efficiency of image generation in diffusion models. Traditional diffusion models often require multiple inference steps, leading to significant computational demands. To address this, Hyper-SD combines two primary approaches: preserving the original Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) trajectory and reformulating it for improved performance.

**Key components of Hyper-SD include:**

* **Trajectory Segmented Consistency Distillation (TSCD):** This technique divides the time steps into segments, enforcing consistency within each segment. By progressively reducing the number of segments, the model achieves all-time consistency, effectively preserving the original ODE trajectory from a higher-order perspective.

* **Human Feedback Learning:** Incorporating human feedback enhances the model's performance in low-step regimes, mitigating performance loss during the distillation process.

* **Score Distillation with Unified LoRA:** Integrating score distillation further improves low-step generation capabilities. The use of a unified Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) supports the inference process across all steps.

Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that Hyper-SD achieves state-of-the-art performance with 1 to 8 inference steps for both SDXL and SD1.5 models. For instance, in a 1-step inference scenario, Hyper-SDXL surpasses SDXL-Lightning by +0.68 in CLIP Score and +0.51 in Aesthetic Score.
