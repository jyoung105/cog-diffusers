## Abstract

(Summarized by GPT-4o)

The paper titled "Phased Consistency Model" introduces the Phased Consistency Model (PCM) to enhance high-resolution, text-conditioned image generation. Traditional Latent Consistency Models (LCMs) often face challenges such as limited flexibility in selecting Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) scales, sensitivity to negative prompts, inconsistencies across different inference steps, and blurriness in low-step generation settings. 

To address these issues, 
**PCM segments the Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) trajectory into multiple sub-trajectories**, facilitating more effective learning and mitigating the identified limitations. 

Evaluations demonstrate that PCM significantly outperforms LCMs across 1 to 16-step generation settings. Notably, PCM achieves superior or comparable one-step generation results compared to previously state-of-the-art methods specifically designed for one-step generation. Additionally, PCM's methodology extends to video generation, enabling the training of state-of-the-art few-step text-to-video generators. 

The authors have made additional resources available, including a project page and code repository, to facilitate further exploration and application of PCM.
